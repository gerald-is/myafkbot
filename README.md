## ✨ What It Does

Aurora is not just an AFK bot that sits still — it **actually behaves like a real player**. It moves around randomly, eats food, responds to greetings, and pathfinds to players on command.

```
[22:36:42] OK    Spawned in as aurora_assistant.
[22:36:43] INFO  Auto-eat enabled.
[22:36:43] OK    Status server running on http://localhost:8080
[22:36:44] CHAT  <Sunil> hello bot!
[22:36:45] CHAT  -> Sunil: Hi Sunil! Type !help to see what I can do.
[22:36:52] CHAT  <Sunil> !come
[22:36:52] CHAT  -> Sunil: Coming to you, Sunil!
```

## 🚀 Features

| Feature | Description |
|---|---|
| 🏃 **Anti-AFK Movement** | Random walking, looking around, jumping, treading water — looks like a real player |
| 🗺️ **Pathfinding** | `!come`, `!goto x y z`, `!follow` — bot physically walks to locations |
| 🍖 **Auto-Eat** | Automatically eats when hunger drops below a threshold |
| 🔐 **Auto Auth** | Handles `/register` and `/login` on AuthMe-style servers |
| 🔁 **Auto-Reconnect** | Exponential backoff reconnect — survives kicks, restarts, and network blips |
| 📡 **Live Status Page** | Web dashboard at `localhost:8080` showing HP, position, uptime, etc. |
| ⚙️ **Config File** | Everything configurable via `config.json` — no code editing needed |
| 🌍 **Environment Variables** | `.env` override support for cloud/hosting deployments |

---

## 📋 Requirements

- **Node.js 18 or newer** — [Download here](https://nodejs.org)
- A Minecraft Java Edition server (cracked/offline or premium)

> ⚠️ **Version Note:** Mineflayer supports specific Minecraft versions. Check which versions are supported by running `node -e "require('minecraft-data').supportedVersions.pc.slice(-5).forEach(v=>console.log(v))"` after installing. Use a matching server version.
>
> If your server shows a build number like `26.1.2` (PaperMC), that is **not** the Minecraft version. Check your panel for the actual MC version (e.g. `1.21.1`) and use that.

## 💬 Chat Commands

Type these in Minecraft chat (default prefix: `!`):

| Command | What it does |
|---|---|
| `!help` | List all available commands |
| `!ping` | Check bot's latency |
| `!status` | Show HP, food, position, uptime |
| `!players` | List visible online players |
| `!time` | Current in-game time (day/night) |
| `!inv` | Show bot's inventory |
| `!come` | Bot walks to you |
| `!goto <x> <y> <z>` | Bot walks to coordinates |
| `!follow [player]` | Bot continuously follows a player |
| `!stop` | Stop all movement |

The bot also auto-replies to greetings like `hello` or `how are you` in chat.

## 🌐 Environment Variables

You can override any `config.json` value via environment variables — useful for hosting platforms where you set env vars in a dashboard:

```env
MC_HOST=play.myserver.net
MC_PORT=25565
MC_VERSION=1.21.1
MC_USERNAME=aurora_assistant
MC_AUTH=offline
MC_PASSWORD=
```

Copy `.env.example` to `.env` to get started.

## 📡 Status Web Page

While the bot is running, open **http://localhost:8080** in your browser:

```
aurora_assistant

## 🔧 Running 24/7

To keep the bot online when you close your computer, deploy it somewhere:

| Platform | Notes |
|---|---|
| **Railway** | Free tier available, set env vars in dashboard, deploys from GitHub |
| **Render** | Free tier (spins down after inactivity — use the status page as ping target) |
| **VPS** (DigitalOcean, Contabo, etc.) | Most reliable, use `pm2` to manage the process |
| **Raspberry Pi** | Great for home 24/7 hosting |

**Using PM2 on a VPS:**
```bash
npm install -g pm2
pm2 start index.js --name aurora-bot
pm2 save
pm2 startup
```

## ❓ Troubleshooting

**`unsupported protocol version`**
→ Your `config.json` version doesn't match the server. Use the actual Minecraft version string (e.g. `"1.21.1"`), not the software build number. PaperMC shows its own build number (like `26.1.2`) — ignore that and find the actual MC version.

**Bot connects but immediately disconnects**
→ The server may require a valid Minecraft account. Set `"auth": "microsoft"` in config and authenticate via the browser device code shown in console on first run.

**`Cannot find module`**
→ Run `npm install` again inside the bot folder.

**Bot keeps reconnecting in a loop**
→ Check the server is actually online and that the version in `config.json` matches exactly.
